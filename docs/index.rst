Welcome to EVN!
===================================

**EVN** is a Robotics System that we view as the natural evolution of LEGO® MINDSTORMS®.

It is built around the EVN Alpha - a Technic-compatible robot controller with 26 ports for I2C, UART, Servos, EV3 and NXT Motors, etc.

On this page, you will find user guides for EVN Alpha, hardware information and documentation for the EVN Arduino library, 
which uses the Arduino-Pico core by Earle Philhower for RP2040-based boards.

Community Projects
------------------

* `Lua-EVN`_ is a port of the Lua scripting language to EVN, with support for the EVN library classes and functionalities. As outlined in the repository's README, Lua has many interesting benefits over C++. Check it out!
